      content="Ferrari's racing legacy is a storied and integral part of the brand's identity, representing a commitment to motorsport excellence that spans over seven decades. Since its inception in 1947, Ferrari has been a dominant force on racetracks worldwide, accumulating a remarkable number of victories in Formula One (F1), endurance racing, and various GT championships.
      In Formula One, Ferrari stands out as the most successful and enduring team, having participated in every season since the championship's inception in 1950. The Prancing Horse has secured numerous Constructors' and Drivers' Championships, with legendary drivers like Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen etching their names in the annals of F1 history while donning the iconic red race suit.
      Ferrari's endurance racing success is epitomized by its triumphs at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, where the brand has a rich history of victories dating back to the 1950s. The iconic Ferrari 250 GTO and the more recent 488 GTE have left an indelible mark on the endurance racing scene."
